            <p>Hey, we are Jenny and Pati. We met in 2020 and after just a few months we bought a van together and built it to match our own ideas. In the three years that followed, we travelled Europe together in our van Marshall and really discovered our passion for travel.</p>
            <p>We therefore decided to leave Europe for a longer period of time and explore the world. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-6-middle margin-b4"> 
            <h3>Jenny</h3>
            <p>Jenny is 28 years old and has worked as a speech therapist in Austrian hospitals for the last three years. She studied and lived in Innsbruck. Ever since she was young, she has wanted to see as much of the world as possible. In 2018, she decided to go to America for a year. After this exciting year, she went on to Australia for six months. </p>
            <p>Jenny is certainly the more organized of the two of us, but still always spontaneous and up for anything. On our current trip, she is most looking forward to exploring the Philippines.</p>

            <h3>Pati</h3>
            <p>Pati is 27 years old and studied civil engineering in Austria. He has lived in Innsbruck for the last six years, first with some friends in a student flat in the city center and then for the last few years together with Jenny on the outskirts of the city. He started playing the drums as a young boy. As a member of the band, he practiced at every opportunity until he started traveling.</p>
            <p>Pati is someone who is easily inspired by new and exciting things. He is up for (almost) any kind of nonsense. What he is most looking forward to on this trip is going diving again and, above all, diving together with Jenny. </p>
